###### mobile device, backside interaction using the rear camera as an input sensor. 

## INSTALLATION

Due to the fact that Taps and Swipes cannot currently be detected at the same time, you have to make a choice between the [two provided APKs](https://github.com/everettmthunzi/back-of-device/releases/tag/final). The supported actions are described in the Report. If you wish to compile the project yourself, simply import the project into Android Studio; it contains all necessary dependencies.

See also the [Backhand module](https://github.com/elmeyer/backhand) as part of this app.

## USAGE:  :+1: :+1:
* lighting plays a critical role with the camera input sensor, as such ensure usage under good back-lighting conditions.
* when tapping the camera, use between slow and moderate speeds (not fast), assuming index finger position as illustrated below.
